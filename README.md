Install using setup.py

```

```

## Configuration

Before running the loadimpact cli you need to add your [Load Impact V3 API token](https://app.loadimpact.com/account/api-token)(located at the user profile settings) and the default project you wish to work with to the config file.

The config file will be placed:

For MacOSX:

```
/Library/Application Support/LoadImpact/config.ini
```

For Linux:

```
~/.config/LoadImpact/config.ini
```

The config file should look like this:

```
[user_settings]
api_token=your_api_token
```

You can also specify the default project you want to work with here by adding the id of the project you wish to work with:

```
[user_settings]
api_token=your_api_token
default_project=2
```

Optionally, if you don't want to edit the config-file you can set default project and api key as environment variables instead:


```
export LOADIMPACT_API_TOKEN='your_api_token'
export LOADIMPACT_DEFAULT_PROJECT=1
```
